## This contract works as follows:

- The organizer sets the prize of the tournament and deposits twice that price into the contract i.e. if the price is 1 token, the participant will have to deposits 0.1 to take part in the tournament, so as to avoid spammer and hackers, bring only the gold.

- The participant deposits 0.1 token as well. Simply by depositing some token as an collateral for their genuineness, that person is marked as the buyer.

Note: The reason they deposit extra money is to lock both parties into an arrangement that neither party can unilaterally walk away from.

That’s it. Note how the typical concerns with transacting without an escrow are now gone. The participant doesn’t have to worry about sending the item and never getting paid, because he can see that the organizer has already put up the money in the smart contract and is compelled to follow through. Conversely, the buyer doesn’t have to worry about selling money to a seller that will never ship the item, because she never sends the money into the organizer’s hands.
